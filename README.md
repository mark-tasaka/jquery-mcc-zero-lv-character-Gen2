# jquery-mcc-zero-lv-character-Gen2
A zero-level character generator for Goodman Games' Mutant Crawl Classics pen and paper game system designed with JQuery/JavaScript.  In this iteration of the zero-level character generator, four randomly generated Mutant Crawl Classics characters are generated for each page.  Seperate JavaScript files have been created, which are shared among the generator 'classes'. This, in turn, increases the amount of cohesion and lowers the coupling; an aim in program design.
